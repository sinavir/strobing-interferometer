# Glossary

### Bias

Either the voltage applied to the piezo holding the back glass mirror or the
effective displacement of the mirror caused by this piezo.


### Calibration curve

This is the intensity value of light received on one camera pixel as a function
of the bias value. It enables us to map intensity change to effective
displacement of the membrane
